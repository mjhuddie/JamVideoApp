{"name":"JamVideo","tagline":"","body":"JamVideo is an app for playing videos from a media server onto your iPhone or iPad. JamVideo only works with MP4 video files because this is the native type supported by iOS devices. Compatible video files on your server will usually have names ending in 'mp4' or 'm4v' and will be encoded using the MPEG4 or H264 formats. These files can be created from your DVD collection using software such as Handbrake. Your media server has to be a 'UPnP-AV' server; media servers tested with JamVideo include Twonky Server, miniDLNA and XBMC.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
